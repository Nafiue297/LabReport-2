# IDDFS Maze Solver  

This project implements the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm to solve a maze problem.  

## Features  
- Takes a 2D grid as input (0 = open path, 1 = wall)  
- Finds a path using IDDFS  
- Outputs traversal order and depth  

## How to Run  
1. Install Python (if not installed)  
2. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python iddfs_maze_solver.py
